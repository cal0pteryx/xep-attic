       <a name="intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p class="" style="">
      XMPP as a protocol was designed before the wide spread adoption of mobile
      devices, and is often cited as not being very mobile friendly as a result.
      However, this mostly stems from undocumented lore and outdated notions of
      how XMPP works. As the Internet and protocol design have changed to be
      more accommodating for mobile, so has XMPP.
    </p>
    <p class="" style="">
      This XEP aims to provide useful background knowledge of mobile handset
      behavior, and those considerations that client and server designers can
      take to ensure that bandwidth and battery are used efficiently.
    </p>
  <h2>2.
       <a name="overview" id="overview">Overview</a></h2>
    <p class="" style="">
      The two major constraints on mobile devices are power and bandwidth.
      With the wide spread proliferation of 3G and LTE technologies, mobile
      bandwidth and speeds have become broadly comparable to broadband.
      However, they are still relatively expensive compared to traditional wired
      networks, and therefore conserving them is still desirable.
      This XEP mostly focuses on LTE as it already has a very wide deployment
      and will only continue to further replace 3G technologies.
    </p>
  <h2>3.
       <a name="compression" id="compression">Compression</a></h2>
    <p class="" style="">
      XML, and by extension XMPP, is known to be highly compressible.
      Compression of XMPP data can be achieved with the DEFLATE algorithm
      (<span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951">RFC 1951</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm90">1</a>]) via TLS compression (<span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3749">RFC 3749</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm94">2</a>]) or <span class="ref" style=""><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0138.html">Stream Compression (XEP-0138)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm98">3</a>] (which also
      supports other compression algorithms).
      A description of the security implications of stream compression is beyond
      the scope of this document (See <span class="ref" style=""><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3749">RFC 3749</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm94">2</a>] or <span class="ref" style=""><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0138.html">Stream Compression (XEP-0138)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm98">3</a>] for more
      information), but the author does not recommend using TLS compression with
      XMPP (or in general).
      If compression must be used, stream level compression should be
      implemented instead, and the compressed stream should have a full flush
      performed on stanza boundaries to help prevent chosen plaintext attacks.
      While this may mitigate some of the benefits of compression by raising
      compression ratios, in a large, real world deployment, network traffic was
      still observed to decrease by a factor of 0.58 when enabling <span class="ref" style=""><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0138.html">Stream Compression (XEP-0138)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm98">3</a>]
      with ZLIB compression.
    </p>
    <p class="" style="">
      While the CPU cost of compression may directly translate to higher power
      usage, it is vastly outweighed by the benefits of reduced network
      utilization, especially on modern LTE networks which use a great deal more
      power per bit than 3G networks as will be seen later in this document.
      However, CPU usage is also not guaranteed to rise due to compression.
      In the aforementioned deployment of stream compression, a
      <span class="em">decrease</span> in CPU utilization by a factor of 0.60 was observed,
      presumably due to reductions in TLS and packet handling overhead.
      Therefore CPU time spent on compression (for ZLIB, at least; other
      algorithms were not tested) can be considered negligable.
    </p>
    <p class="" style="">
      Supporting compression and performming a full flush on stanza boundaries
      is recommended for mobile devices.
    </p>
  <h2>4.
       <a name="power" id="power">Power Consumption</a></h2>
    <p class="" style="">
      While the wide spread adoption of LTE has dramatically increased available
      bandwidth on mobile devices, it has also increased power consumption.
      According to one study, early LTE devices consumed 5–20% more power
      than their 3G counterparts  [<a href="#nt-idm117">4</a>].
      On some networks that support the legacy SVLTE (Simultaneous Voice and
      LTE) or CSFB (Circuit-switched fallback) instead of the more modern VoLTE
      (Voice Over LTE) standard, this number would (presumably) be even higher.
    </p>
    <p class="" style="">
      XMPP server and client implementers, bearing this increased power usage in
      mind, and knowing a bit about how LTE radios work, can optimize their
      traffic to minimize network usage.
      For the downlink, LTE user equipment
      (UE) utilizes Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), which is
      somewhat inefficient  [<a href="#nt-idm120">5</a>].
      On the uplink side a different technology, Single-carrier frequency
      division multiple access (SC-FDMA) is used, which is slightly more
      efficient than traditional OFDM, slightly offsetting the fact that
      broadcasting requires more power than receiving.
      LTE UE also implements a Discontinuous reception (DRX) mode in which the
      hardware can sleep until it is woken by a paging message or is needed to
      perform some task.
      LTE radios have two power modes: RRC_CONNECTED and RRC_IDLE.
      DRX is supported in both of these power modes.
      By attempting to minimize the time which the LTE UE state machine spends
      in the RCC_CONNECTED state, and maximize the time it stays in the DRX
      state (for RCC_CONNECTED and RRC_IDLE), we can increase battery life
      without degrading the XMPP experience.
      To do so, the following rules should be observed:
    </p>
    <div class="indent"><h3>4.1 <a name="sect-idm122" id="sect-idm122">Transmit no data</a></h3>
      <p class="" style="">
        Whenever possible, data that is not strictly needed should not be
        transmitted (by the server or client).
        Supporting <span class="ref" style=""><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0352.html">Client State Indication (XEP-0352)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idm126">6</a>] is recommended.
        Most importantly, XMPP pings should be kept as far apart as possible and
        only used when necessary.
        Server operators are encouraged to set high ping timeouts, and client
        implementors are advised to only send pings when absolutely necessary to
        prevent the server from closing the socket.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="indent"><h3>4.2 <a name="sect-idm128" id="sect-idm128">When transmitting, transmit as much as you can</a></h3>
      <p class="" style="">
        If one is on 3G, transmitting a small amount of data will cause the
        radio to enter FACH mode which is significantly cheaper than its high
        power mode.
        On LTE radios, however, transmitting small amounts of data is vastly
        more expensive per bit due to the higher tail-time (the time it takes
        for the radio to change state) of approximately 11 seconds [<a href="#nt-idm120">5</a>].
        On LTE radios, one should transmit as much data from the client as
        possible when the radio is already on (eg. by placing messages in a send
        queue and executing the queue as a batch when the radio is on).
        Similarly, when data is being received from the server, the mobile
        devices radio is already in a high power state and therefore any data
        that needs to be sent to the server should be transmitted.
      </p>
      <p class="" style="">
        These rules also apply to server operators: If the server receives data,
        the phones radio is already on, therefore you should flush any pending
        data as soon as possible after receiving data from a client.
